					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to experiemnt with JavaScript arrays adn objects. This required me to experiment on my chrome console, create Javascript code on VSC, and link the JavaScript file to my HTML code.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Tasks 1 to 2 where easy as long as you follow the assignments. But it was when I arrived to Task 3 was when I ran into a problem. HTML would not read the JavaScript file I made and refused to show the file on the webpage. I was able to resolve the issue with the help of my partner and of couese ChatGPT. The issue was that I didn't use the proper word in JavaScript when I was making the output and there was a space missing in the code. Once those errors where fixed there where no more problems.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put a few hours into this assignmet, ensuring that I understood what I was doing. I won't lie I was a bit annoyed trying to figgure out why I was having a problem with Task 3. Especially after following the steps given to us on Canvas. But as soon as I realized what the issue was and fixed it I was full of excitemt and joy. It was a great exercise and it allowed me consider all resources at my disposal to help me understadn why thigs work and don't work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
