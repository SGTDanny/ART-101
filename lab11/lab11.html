            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>The problems I had was ensuring that everything was properly organized so that the right files would be pulled. At first I had issues having the text appear following input and pressing the button. The button worked, but apparently I left code out of the function so it was not being pulled. It worked perfectly after I placed the code witin the function.</p>
