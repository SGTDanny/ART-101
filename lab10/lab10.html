                <p>The assigment asked for me to experiment with DOM manipulation. This required us to create a function, an event listener, a call back, and an outpot dive. The goal was to create a button that would generate random text after being pressed.</p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p> I ran into the a few broblems while trying to generate random text. I tested the button out and found that it was working, but there was no output. What ended up being the problem was that the path to my CSS was not properly established and there was a few words that where not matching.</p>
