					<h2>Challenge</h2>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was having issues having my script appear on my websigt. After looking it over with my partner, I realised that I misstyped a piece of code in JavaScprit. The issue was resolved following that. I also had issues modiffying the immage, but that was becaseu of rules I set in the div that canceld out the other rules I wanted to add. </p>
