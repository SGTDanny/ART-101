            <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>Experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks in Javascript.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>This was an interesting lab. I am still trying to wrap my head around the subject matter and trying to understad exatly waht I am doing. This has lead me to rely on the guidence provided for us. This ment that I used the example provided in the assignment to complete it. It seems easy going step by step, but I think I am having issues understanding how to work with the varriable itself and applying the array.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
