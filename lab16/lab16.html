            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I was having issues with pulling the datat from the endpoint. There was an error message on my consol that prestty much said that the data, was not able to be read by the site. I asked my classmate Ian to review my code and he told be two things. First, I needed to add an extention that allowed for CORS to be unblock. Second, I needed to lower case URL in JavaScript. I was able to fix my problems by following those tow directions. </p>
